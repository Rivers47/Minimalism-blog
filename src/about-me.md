# Aboute Me

I graduated from computer science but that's not where my interest is;
I live in North America but that's not what my sleep follows; I play the piano but that's
not what I want to do the most in music is.

I am currently undergoing exposure thearpy on Math and anything that requires using brain.

I also play Touhou Project, so you can probably see some posts about it.
